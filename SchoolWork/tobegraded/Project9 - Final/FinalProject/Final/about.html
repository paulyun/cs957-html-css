        <p>My name is Paul Yun and I am a freelance cinematographer and editor.  I have been creating films since I was in high school 
        and now I am freelancing with private clients all over the world. I have a passion for making videos. If you give me footage, I 
        will try to make something out of it. Creating an effective video is a challenge for me and a creative process that stimulates my 
        brain. Areas I specialize in:</p>
        <ol class="items">
            <li>Sports Cinematography</li>
            <li>Sports Photography</li>
